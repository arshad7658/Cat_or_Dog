A binary CNN model trained on two classes of data - dog and cat. Each class contained 1000 images, which were further augmented using ImageDataGenerator class of keras. Open the notebook file for viewing the code or use the 'model.keras' file to deploy.
Accuracy was around 0.89.
Will further improve the model as I keep learning.
